## Exercise #1: Sending an External Signal

During this exercise, you will:

- Define and handle a Signal
- Retrieve a handle on the Workflow to Signal
- Send an external Signal
- Use a Temporal Client to submit execution requests for both Workflows

Make your changes to the code in the `practice` subdirectory (look for
`TODO` comments that will guide you to where you should make changes to
the code). If you need a hint or want to verify your changes, look at
the complete version in the `solution` subdirectory.

### This is the end of the exercise.
